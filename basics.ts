1.Typescript makes JavaScript code simple, easier to read and debug
2.Typescript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEâ€™s and practises, like static checking to avoid bugs in the production
3.Structural rather than nominal. 
4.TypeScript code can be compiled asper ES6 and  ES5 standards to support the latest browse.
5.TypeScript Supports type definition for existing JavaScript libraries.
6.TypeScript Supports object oriented programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance etc

/* 
By definition TypeScript is JavaScript for application scale development 
TypeScript nothing but JavaScript with some additional features 
TypeScript is a strongly typed object oriented compiled language 
powerful type system including generics
Typescript gives us all the benefits of ES6 plus more productivity
